# Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false
# otherwise.
#
#  A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original
# string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the
# relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of
# "abcde" while "aec" is not).
#
#
#  Example 1:
#  Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
# Output: true
#
#  Example 2:
#  Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
# Output: false
#
#
#  Constraints:
#
#
#  0 <= s.length <= 100
#  0 <= t.length <= 10‚Å¥
#  s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
#
#
#
# Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming
# s, say
# s1, s2, ..., sk where
# k >= 10‚Åπ, and you want to check one by one to see if
# t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?
